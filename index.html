                <p><em>Business Operations Associate <strong><a href="https://www.klarna.com/uk/">(Klarna)</a></strong> </em></p>
                <p>I work in tech support and hope to become a software engineer. I am interested in becoming a software engineer as it is important to me that I am able to solve real world problems in my career, whilst also challenging myself. I have a very logical and analytical mind, which I utilise when coming up with solutions. I have been learning to code; so far I have been looking at languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which I have found fascinating. I believe technology is fundamental in the world as it is today, and will become even more important with future advancements - I would love to be a part of this. I feel as if I am thriving when learning and expanding my knowledge, which I believe would be very useful in order to keep up with new technologies. </p></td>
